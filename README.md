In this repository, we have implemented four Disk Scheduling Algorithms. The website consists of six web pages out of which two are the Home Page and the About Us Page, and the other four are the different Disk Scheduling Algorithms. Disk scheduling is a technique used by the operating system to schedule multiple requests for accessing the disk. The purpose of disk scheduling algorithms is to reduce the total seek time. 

The four Disk Scheduling Algorithm mentioned here are: -
1.	FCFS (First Come First Serve)
2.	SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First)
3.	Elevator Scan
4.	Circular Scan

When you visit the website first you will interact with Home Page. In it, you can see the four Disk Scheduling Algorithms and on the right top corner, you can find the ‘About Us’ link. You can navigate to any of the four algorithms by clicking on the provided link.

In FCFS, there is the theory of FCFS algorithm and there is a video link provided of the algorithm if you want to know about it. At the top right corner, there are two links for returning to the home page and one to implement to the algorithm. Once you click on the implement link you are navigated to the new page where you can perform the implementation of the algorithm with its graphical representation.

In SSTF, there is the theory of the SSTF algorithm and there is a video link provided of the algorithm if you want to know about it. At the top right corner, there are two links for returning to the home page and one to implement to the algorithm. Once you click on the implement link you are navigated to the new page where you can perform the implementation of the algorithm with its graphical representation.

In Elevator Scan, there is the theory of the Elevator Scan algorithm and there is a video link provided of the algorithm if you want to know about it. At the top right corner, there are two links for returning to the home page and one to implement to the algorithm. Once you click on the implement link you are navigated to the new page where you can perform the implementation of the algorithm with its graphical representation.

In C- Scan, there is the theory of the C- Scan algorithm and there is a video link provided of the algorithm if you want to know about it. At the top right corner, there are two links for returning to the home page and one to implement to the algorithm. Once you click on the implement link you are navigated to the new page where you can perform the implementation of the algorithm with its graphical representation.

On the about page you find the members of this project, and their respective GitHub and LinkedIn Links.
